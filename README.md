![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/russellpwirtz/tarma-blits-solidity/truffle-test.yml)

Welcome to Tarma Blits, a web3 game that allows you to take care of a virtual pet and help it grow and thrive. Similar to popular games like Tamagotchi, you can interact with your pet to improve its well-being. The game uses an ERC20 token as its payment method (earned in-game), allowing players to purchase food and playtime for their pets.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tarma Blits, you will need to have access to a web3 enabled browser, such as MetaMask, and gas in your wallet. Once you have these set up, you can access the game by visiting the website.

## Interacting with your Pet

Once you have accessed the game, you will be able to create a new pet and start interacting with it. Your pet will have three main attributes: happiness, discipline, and energy. You can interact with your pet in various ways to improve these attributes and help your pet grow and thrive.

`Daily Check-In`

Players can earn tokens by completing a daily check-in. By checking in each day, players can earn tokens, allowing them to further care for their pet.

`Feeding your Pet` E+ H+ D-

Your pet will need to eat to maintain its energy levels, which will also increase its happiness (but might cause some discipline to slip). You can feed your pet by clicking on the food icon and spending some tokens. Just don't feed it too much!

`Playing with your Pet` E- H+ D+

Playing with your pet is a great way to improve its happiness and discipline levels. You can play with your pet by clicking on the play icon and spending some tokens, which will also burn some of your pet's energy in the process.

`Disciplining your Pet` E+ H- D+

Disciplining your pet is important to maintain its discipline levels and prevent it from misbehaving. If you see your pet acting badly, you can discipline your pet by clicking on the discipline icon and spending some tokens. Be careful though, if you discipline your pet for no good reason, it can do more harm than good!

`Special Events` E+ H+ D+

Occasionally special events will occur. Interact with your pet during the event to get rewards!
