![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/russellpwirtz/tarma-blits-solidity/truffle-test.yml)

Welcome to Tarma Blits, a web3 game that allows you to take care of a virtual pet and help it grow and thrive. Similar to popular games like Tamagotchi, you can interact with your pet to improve its well-being. The game uses an ERC20 token as its payment method (earned in-game), allowing players to purchase food and playtime for their pets.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tarma Blits, you will need to have access to a web3 enabled browser, such as MetaMask, and gas in your wallet. Once you have these set up, you can access the game by visiting the website.

## Interacting with your Pet

Once you have accessed the game, you will be able to create a new pet and start interacting with it. Your pet will have three main attributes: happiness, discipline, and energy. You can interact with your pet in various ways to improve these attributes and help your pet grow and thrive. Over time your pet will earn more daily checkin tokens but will require more activity to progress.

`Daily Check-In` T+++

Players can earn tokens by completing a daily check-in. These tokens can then be used to perform various activities:

`Feeding your Pet` E++ H+ D- T-

Your pet will need to eat to maintain its energy levels, which will also increase its happiness (but might cause some discipline to slip). You can feed your pet by clicking on the food icon and spending some tokens. Just don't feed it too much!

`Playing with your Pet` E- H++ D+ T-

Playing with your pet is a great way to improve its happiness and discipline levels, at the cost of energy. Example games: hide-n-seek, fetch, walk, memory, rhythm game

`Training your Pet` E+ H- D++ T-

> Legend: E:energy H:happiness D:discipline T:tokens

Training your pet is important to maintain its discipline levels and prevent it from misbehaving. To increase your pet's discipline, you can train your pet, or if you see your pet acting badly you can scold your pet. Be careful though, if you discipline your pet for no good reason, it can do more harm than good!

`Special Events` E++ H++ D++

Occasionally special events will happen at random intervals, which give players a chance to earn extra tokens or boost their pet's attributes. 

## Solidity Code

The Tarma Blits game is built using Solidity code, which is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on EVM-compliant blockchains, such as Ethereum or Polygon. The code for the game is available on GitHub and can be accessed by anyone interested in reviewing or contributing to the project.
